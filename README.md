Welcome to the README, for hair_salon. hair_salon was supposed to be an app that allows you to manage your client list and the stylists you have on hand

Unfortunately it doesn't do that.

All of the back end programming works just fine, but it's almost 5 and I know you guys have a weekend too :)

If someone could give me any feedback on why my save function is working just fine but Stylist.all() was returning an empty array in the get('/') block of my app.rb file I would greatly appreciate it

It is a work in progress by Jim Patt.

Please don't use it at all.  It doesn't work

HAPPY FRIDAY!
